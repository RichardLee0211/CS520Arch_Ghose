Architecture lecture in Binghamton University with Prof. Ghose

honestly, I am a little behind the class process

I like this style

page. 29
master-slaver latch

## class 1 week 3
I feel like I am missing in the notebook

sign-extension: 10bits to 32 bits, fill the extended bits with sign bit value

## class 1 week 4
it's realy fast course
I don't even know what's him talking about

## class 1 week 5

## class 1 week 6

## class 2 week 6
full dependence??

## class 2 week 7
