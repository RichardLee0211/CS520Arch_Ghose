I like this style

page. 29
master-slaver latch

## class 1 week 3
I feel like I am missing in the notebook

sign-extension: 10bits to 32 bits, fill the extended bits with sign bit value

## class 1 week 4
it's realy fast course
I don't even know what's him talking about

# class note study
cann't follow the lecture, what a sad story
